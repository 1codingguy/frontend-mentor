## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS

### Thoughts

1. Some details are not mentioned in the style guide, e.g.:

- border-radius
- box-shadow

  I am sure there are some tiny details my eyes couldn't spot and therfore failed to include in this solution.

2. Tried to name the classes with [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/), but not entirely sure if I got it correct.

3. Read somewhere that a good README file is as important as the project itselfs. So from now on I will make sure to include a README file in every project/ challenge. I reckon it will also help me reviewing the projects somewhere in the future.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This site provides samples of different box-shadow. Able to see the result and simply copy and paste into own's CSS. Very helpful since I am not that familar with the box-shadow properites.

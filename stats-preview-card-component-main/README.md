## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS

### Thoughts

- I could not get the purple color that masked over the image correct. That color is not in the style guide.
- Not sure the mobile width of 375px is fixed width or min-width. I opted for fixed-width so I can try to copy the layout according to the design image.

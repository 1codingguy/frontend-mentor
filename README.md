# frontend-mentor challenges

I started working on [frontend-mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) with the intention of practicing my basic HTML/ CSS skills. Even there are lots of UI component libraries like Bootstrap and Materialize CSS available, I think it's important to get the basic concepts right for a solid fundation.
